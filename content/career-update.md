Summary: An Update on my Career

I have recently made the transition to software engineering full-time. I accepted a role as an Associate Software Engineer on the Cloud Center of Excellence team with T-Mobile.

# How I Made the Transition
I did not take a traditional route when becoming a software engineer. I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, but have always had interest in software development.

## Before T-Mobile
I have worked in three professional roles before making the transition to software development. In all three roles I developed software as a significant responsibility of the role.

**Mechanical Engineering Co-op**

Developed a small application for acquiring data during water heater tests with LabVIEW.

**Test & Evaluation Engineer**

Developed and maintained a large data acquisition application in LabVIEW. This was much more complex application with database interaction, REST API calls, and a complicated UI. This is where I first learned about software development for large applications. I learned about source code control, unit testing, continuous integration and software design as needed as the application grew.

**Research & Development Engineer**

In this role I really grew my Python skills by building a data analysis application for the Test & Evaluation team. This application used many Python libraries including pandas, requests, pytest, and PySimpleGUI. 

**Outside of Work**

To learn web development I developed StrengthLog, a Flask web application for tracking my workouts. I have also used the PyBites platform to learn more about the Python standard library. This was extremely beneficial during my interviews as I wrote unit test with pytest and practiced with pytest on the platform.

# Moving Forward

I plan to write a few posts each month over my learnings at work. I am excited to start my role with T-Mobile and know there will be tons of learnings to do.
