Summary: An Update on my Career
Status: draft

I have recently made the transition to software engineering full-time. I accepted a role as an Associate Software Engineer on the Cloud Center of Excellence team with T-Mobile.

## Before T-Mobile
Before joining T-Mobile, I worked in two roles for Emerson Pressure Management, my most recent role a Research & Development Engineer and before R&D as a Test & Evaluation Engineer (T&E Engineer). These were both roles that I used my background in Mechanical Engineering for, but also had software aspects to them. In my role as a T&E Engineer I owned our data acquisition software and hardware solutions. The responsibility gave me the experience to realize I wanted to make the transition to software engineering full-time. I learned about source code control, unit testing, software architecture, continuous integration and other software topics while developing the applications used in our labs.

## Learning Python
I also spent time creating data analysis tools for our team in Python. I initially used Python to develop personal scripts for data manipulation and analysis in Excel and CSV files. We had monthly presentations in front of the team, where I ended up sharing the results from these tools. There was initial interest from team members to use these tools, but when I explained that these were Python scripts and would require the engineer to write code that interest fell off. I realized that there were significant time savings in common engineering data analysis tasks using these scripts. I took this as an opportunity to help the team and grow my skills in Python. I created a desktop data analysis application to share with my teams using PySimpleGUI, Pandas, Openpyxl and PyInstaller. PySimpleGUI was used for creating the graphical user interface. The application was quite simple and I need to provide a POC pretty quick to show my manager that it could be done.

Outside of Emerson, I spent time learning Python. To learn web development I developed StrengthLog, a Flask web application for tracking my workouts. I have also used the PyBites platform to learn more about the Python standard library. This was extremely beneficial during my interviews as I wrote unit test with pytest and practiced with pytest on the platform.
